 A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. It's a place where you can store your code, your files, and each file's revision history.
 The git add command saves your changes in a file to the staging area, allowing you to compare your local version to the remote repositorys version.
 This command saves a log message along with the commit id of the modifications made to the Git repository.
 Git push.This command pushes the contents of your local repository to the remote repository you ve added. 
 The git clone command takes a path (typically a URL) to the Git repository you want to clone. The command is git clone, and the path to the Git repository you want to clone is passed as an argument.

 Version Control System is used to track versions of the files and store them in a specific place known as repository. The process of copying the content from an existing Git Repository with the help of various Git Tools is termed git cloning.
 Git Repository is the collection of files which are originated from a certain version of the repository. It helps in tracking the changes done by a specific user on one version of the repository. 
 Untracked: In this stage, the Git repository is unable to track the file, which means that the file is never staged nor it is committed. The file is present in the working directory but Git is unaware of its existence.
Tracked: When the Git repository tracks a file, which means the file is committed but is not staged in the working directory. In this the file changes have been committed at some point in the repositoryâ€™s history.
